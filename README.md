In GraphGPS we have changed the posenc_stats.py starting from line 145. (GraphGPS/graphgps/transform/posenc_stats.py)
We have also added our own configs for ogbg-molhiv and ogbg-molpcba (GraphGPS/configs/GPS/ogbg-molhiv-GPS+HIG.yaml, etc.)

In SLURM/graphgps are our commands which we used to access the bwHPC and execute our implementation on it.
